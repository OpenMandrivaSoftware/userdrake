A new version of userdrake is released. It is completly
rewritten from C to Perl (More precisely Gui is now in perl-Gtk2
and backend is in XS). the XS part relies on libuser.
The new userdrake comes with many features and the Gui is now more
consistent (isn't it?). 
Some of the features are:

- Easy way to add/remove users in groups and vice versa
- Dialog box for deleting user's home and user mail spool when removing user
- libuser API (security when accessing users files)
- Ability to put Uid and Gid manually when adding user/group
- Change of the primary group of users
- 2 filters for system and normal users (pattern matching)
- Password aging
- Ability to lock user's account
- User's account expiration
...

Missing features:
- LDAP configuration (coming up)

userdrake2 requires libuser1-0.51.7-2mdk.i586.rpm or higher to work properly

Please test and report bug.
